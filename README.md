## **What are conclusions that we can draw about the crowdfunding campaigns data set?**

Here are three possible conclusions we can draw about the crowdfunding campaigns data set:
1) “Theater” was the most successful category of crowdfunding but also had the most failed campaigns.
2) Crowdfunding activity (activity defined as: successful AND failed campaigns) within the sub-category “plays” eclipsed activity within all other sub-categories.
3) Late Spring/Early Summer (May, June, and especially July) is the time of year that yields the highest results for successful crowdfunding campaigns.





## **What are some limitations of this dataset?**

The methods of each institution’s campaign are unclear.  Different campaigns may have used different strategies to raise money (ie: donor drives, subscriber mailings, promotional sales, cold calls, printed/digital/radio advertisements, etc.). 

The blurb gave limited information on the background of each institution raising money.  If more information on the size and structure (ie: nonprofit, for-profit, etc) of the institution were provided then trends of success could be further pinpointed.   

Some additional questions I had after examining the crowdfunding dataset:  Age of each organization raising funds?  Reason for each organization raising funds:  Salaries? New construction? Products or services to distribute?





## **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?**

Other possible ways to provide value to the dataset provided include creating a table with the date created conversion and the date ended conversion to analyze the length of successful campaigns and we could also create a line graph based on campaign length with a filter on the parent category of campaign to examine any correlation between campaign length and parent category.
